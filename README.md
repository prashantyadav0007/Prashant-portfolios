## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**The good stuff:**
- React 19 + TypeScript (because types are cool)
- Styled Components (CSS-in-JS ftw)
- Framer Motion (makes things go whoosh)
- React Router (page switching magic)

## 🚀 Want to run it locally?

**You'll need:** Node.js (v16+)

```bash
# Clone it


# Install stuff
npm install

# Fire it up
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and boom! 🎉

**Environment Setup:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
REACT_APP_HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_HOST=your-blog.hashnode.dev
```

Replace `your-blog.hashnode.dev` with your Hashnode publication URL (without `https://`).

**Other commands:**
- `npm run build` - Make it ready for production
- `npm test` - Run tests (if I wrote any lol)


## 📦 Deployment

Currently live on **Netlify** because it's awesome and free.

```bash
npm run build  # Creates production build
```
